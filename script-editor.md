Your task is to create a version of the deployment script intended specifically for execution by AI agents.

Break the task down into these steps:

## 1: Create agent specific deployment script

- Unlike the main version of the deployment script in this repository, the agent-specific version, which should be named `agent_deploy.sh`, is intended for execution by AI agents. 

- Unlike the main deployment script, its objective is to minimize the number of console lines, reducing the verbosity to the minimum extent necessary for the agent to be able to provide the user with status updates regarding the deployment.
